

1.What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
Select customer_id , sum(price)
 from dannys_diner.sales join dannys_diner.menu
 on sales.product_id =menu.product_id
 group by(customer_id)
 Order by(customer_id);
 
 


2.How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
Select customer_id , count(distinct(order_date))
from dannys_diner.sales
group by(customer_id) ;

   
3.What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

      SELECT s.customer_id,
       m.product_name
      FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
      JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id,
           MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS first_orders ON s.customer_id = first_orders.customer_id
                  AND s.order_date = first_orders.first_order_date;


Another Approach :
WITH ordered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date, 
    menu.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM ordered_sales
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;

  
   
4 .What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
A .   SELECT COUNT(s.product_id) as count ,m.product_name
 FROM dannys_diner.sales as s
 inner join dannys_diner.menu as m
 on s.product_id=m.product_id 
 group by(product_name)
 order by( COUNT(s.product_id)) desc 
 limit 1
;


5.Which item was the most popular for each customer?





 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
 7.Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8.What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9.If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?


10.In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
